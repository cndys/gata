# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
MobilityCorp needs to build a scalable platform that can:
- Handle different vehicle types with varying requirements
- Scale different components independently based on load
- Enable rapid feature development and deployment
- Support multiple user interfaces (customer, technician, corporate)
- Integrate with numerous external systems
- Allow for gradual migration from legacy systems

## Decision
We will adopt a microservices architecture pattern with domain-driven design principles for service boundaries.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Independent Scaling**: Services can scale based on their specific load patterns
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use appropriate technology stacks
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't cascade to entire system
- **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can own and deploy services independently
- **Incremental Migration**: Can migrate from legacy system service by service

### Negative
- **Operational Complexity**: More services to deploy, monitor, and maintain
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication adds latency
- **Data Consistency**: Distributed transactions are complex
- **Testing Complexity**: Integration testing becomes more challenging

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture
- **Pros**: Simpler deployment, easier debugging, better performance
- **Cons**: Scaling limitations, technology lock-in, deployment risks
- **Reason for rejection**: Doesn't support independent scaling needs

### Serverless Architecture
- **Pros**: No infrastructure management, automatic scaling, pay-per-use
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, cold starts, limited execution time
- **Reason for rejection**: Real-time vehicle control needs persistent connections

## Implementation Notes
- Use API Gateway for external communication
- Implement service mesh for internal communication
- Use event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- Apply circuit breakers for fault tolerance
- Implement distributed tracing for observability
