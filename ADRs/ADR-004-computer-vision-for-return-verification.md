# ADR-004: Computer Vision for Return Verification

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Current return process issues:
- Manual photo review is time-consuming and inconsistent
- Fraud through fake photos or wrong vehicle returns
- Disputes over vehicle damage claims
- Incorrect parking spot usage
- EV charger connection verification needed

We need automated verification that is accurate, fast, and provides evidence for disputes.

## Decision
Implement multi-stage computer vision pipeline:
1. **Edge Processing**: Initial validation on mobile device
2. **Cloud Analysis**: Detailed damage detection and verification
3. **Human Fallback**: Manual review for uncertain cases
4. **Evidence Storage**: Immutable photo storage for disputes

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Fraud Reduction**: 70% reduction in fraudulent returns expected
- **Faster Processing**: <10 second verification vs minutes for manual
- **Consistent Standards**: Eliminates human subjectivity
- **Evidence Trail**: Photos provide dispute resolution
- **Cost Reduction**: Fewer customer service agents needed

### Negative
- **False Positives**: May flag legitimate returns incorrectly
- **Photo Quality**: Depends on lighting and user compliance
- **Privacy Concerns**: Storage and processing of images
- **Initial Investment**: Model training and infrastructure costs

## Alternatives Considered

### Manual Review Only
- **Pros**: Human judgment, simple implementation
- **Cons**: Slow, expensive, inconsistent, doesn't scale

### IoT Sensors Only
- **Pros**: Automatic, no user action needed
- **Cons**: High hardware cost, maintenance overhead, limited coverage

### Hybrid Manual Sampling
- **Pros**: Balance of automation and human review
- **Cons**: Misses fraud patterns, inconsistent user experience
