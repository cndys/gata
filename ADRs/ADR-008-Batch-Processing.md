# ADR-008: Batch Processing over Real-time Analytics for Reporting

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Our platform requires data analytics and reporting capabilities for:
- Business intelligence dashboards
- Performance metrics and KPIs
- Historical trend analysis
- Compliance and audit reports
- Customer behavior insights

Current considerations:
- Most business reports don't require real-time freshness
- Cost optimization is a key business requirement
- Analytics workloads are resource-intensive

## Decision

Adopt batch processing as the primary approach for analytics and reporting:
- **Scheduled ETL jobs**: Process data in batches (hourly, daily)
- **Batch analytics**: Use Spark for large-scale data processing
- **Near real-time exceptions**: Only for critical alerts and monitoring
- **Data freshness SLA**: Acceptable delay of 1-24 hours for most reports
- **Cost optimization**: Leverage off-peak computing resources

Architecture components:
- Apache Spark for batch processing
- Delta Lake for reliable data storage
- Pre-computed aggregations and materialized views
- Real-time processing only for critical system alerts

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Cost efficiency**: lower infrastructure costs compared to streaming
- **Resource optimization**: Better utilization through batching and scheduling
- **Simplicity**: Easier to develop, test, and maintain batch jobs
- **Data quality**: More time for validation and error handling
- **Scalability**: Batch jobs can process large volumes efficiently
- **Debugging**: Easier to troubleshoot and replay failed processes

### Negative
- **Data latency**: Reports may be hours behind real-time data
- **Recovery time**: Longer time to recover from failures

## Alternatives Considered

### Real-time Streaming Analytics
- Pros: Immediate data freshness, real-time insights
- Cons: higher infrastructure costs, complex state management

### Lambda Architecture (Batch + Stream)
- Pros: Best of both worlds, flexible data freshness
- Cons: High operational complexity, dual code paths to maintain
