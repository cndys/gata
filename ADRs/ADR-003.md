# ADR-003: AI/ML Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
MobilityCorp's competitive advantage depends on AI/ML capabilities for:
- Demand prediction for vehicle positioning
- Computer vision for return verification and fraud prevention
- Predictive maintenance to reduce downtime
- Route optimization for technicians
- Dynamic pricing and user behavior analysis
- Carpooling matching algorithms

AI technology is rapidly evolving, and we need flexibility to adapt to new models and providers.

## Decision
We will build an abstracted AI/ML platform that:
1. Separates model implementation from business logic
2. Supports multiple model providers (in-house, cloud APIs, open-source)
3. Implements feature stores for consistent data processing
4. Uses model registry for versioning and rollback
5. Provides fallback mechanisms when AI services are unavailable

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Provider Flexibility**: Can switch between AI providers without system changes
- **Cost Optimization**: Mix of in-house and cloud models based on cost/performance
- **Rapid Innovation**: Easy to test and deploy new models
- **Risk Mitigation**: Not locked into single provider's pricing or availability
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning if AI fails

### Negative
- **Abstraction Overhead**: Additional layer adds complexity
- **Integration Effort**: Multiple provider integrations to maintain
- **Consistency Challenges**: Different models may have varying behaviors
- **Training Costs**: Need expertise in multiple AI platforms

## Alternatives Considered

### Single Cloud AI Provider
- **Pros**: Simpler integration, consistent APIs, managed infrastructure
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, pricing risk, limited customization
- **Reason for rejection**: Risk of provider changes or price increases

### Fully In-House ML
- **Pros**: Complete control, custom models, data privacy
- **Cons**: High initial cost, talent requirements, slower innovation
- **Reason for rejection**: Time to market and expertise constraints

### No AI Abstraction
- **Pros**: Direct integration, less complexity
- **Cons**: Tight coupling, difficult migrations, no fallback options
- **Reason for rejection**: Violates uncertainty management principle

## Implementation Notes
- Start with cloud APIs for rapid deployment
- Gradually build in-house models for core differentiators
- Implement A/B testing framework for model comparison
- Monitor model performance and costs continuously
- Build fallback rules for each AI-powered feature
