## Component Details

### Core Components

1. **Fleet Service API**
   - RESTful endpoints for fleet operations
   - GraphQL for complex queries
   - WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Request validation and routing

2. **Vehicle Manager**
   - Vehicle lifecycle management
   - Status tracking (available, rented, maintenance)
   - Lock/unlock command processing
   - Vehicle assignment logic

3. **Telemetry Processor**
   - Real-time GPS tracking
   - Battery level monitoring
   - Speed and usage analytics
   - Anomaly detection

4. **Maintenance Scheduler**
   - Predictive maintenance algorithms
   - Work order generation
   - Technician assignment
   - Parts inventory management

### State Management

5. **Fleet State Store**
   - In-memory cache for vehicle status
   - Distributed state synchronization
   - Event sourcing for state changes
   - Snapshot persistence

### Monitoring Components

6. **Location Tracker**
   - Geofencing validation
   - Route tracking
   - Parking spot verification
   - Movement pattern analysis

7. **Battery Monitor**
   - Charge level tracking
   - Range prediction
   - Charging status monitoring
   - Battery health assessment

8. **Redistribution Engine**
   - Demand hotspot identification
   - Optimal redistribution planning
   - Cost-benefit analysis
   - Technician route optimization

### Integration Layer

9. **Vehicle Command Queue**
   - Command buffering
   - Retry logic
   - Priority queuing
   - Command acknowledgment

10. **Hardware Abstraction**
    - Protocol translation
    - Vendor-specific adapters
    - Error handling
    - Connection management

## Key Responsibilities

- **Real-time Operations**: Instant vehicle control and monitoring
- **Predictive Analytics**: Maintenance and demand forecasting
- **Optimization**: Fleet distribution and utilization
- **Integration**: Seamless hardware communication

## Data Flow

1. Telemetry data flows from vehicles through Hardware Abstraction
2. Telemetry Processor analyzes and stores in Fleet State Store
3. Location Tracker and Battery Monitor update vehicle status
4. Maintenance Scheduler triggers work orders based on predictions
5. Redistribution Engine optimizes fleet placement
6. Commands flow back through Vehicle Command Queue to hardware
