## Introduction

MobilityCorp provides short-term rentals for last-mile transport with bikes, scooters, cars, or vans in the European Union.

In each of the 27 countries, we offer 5,000 bikes, 5,000 scooters, 200 cars, and 200 vans. Users rent these vehicles on our booking platform.
[Add details: car reservations 7 days in advance, etc.

All these means of transport run on electric motors, so we have technicians who maintain these vehicles and, in particular, change the batteries when they are worn out.

Each vehicle sends metrics 
every 30 seconds [+ or - ?]
