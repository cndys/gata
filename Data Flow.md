# Data Flow Architecture

## Overview
End-to-end data flow from user interactions to AI-powered decisions.

## Primary Data Flows

### 1. Booking Flow
```
User App -> API Gateway -> Booking Service
    |                           |
    v                           v
User Profile <- User Service   Fleet Service
    |                           |
    v                           v
Risk Score                  Vehicle Assignment
    |                           |
    +-----------> AI Platform <-+
                      |
                  Demand Prediction
                      |
                Dynamic Pricing -> Payment Service
                      |
                Confirmation -> Notification Service -> User
```

### 2. Vehicle Telemetry Flow
```
Vehicle IoT -> Edge Node -> Event Stream
                  |              |
              Local Cache    Fleet Service
                            /    |    \
                           /     |     \
                    Analytics  AI/ML  Monitoring
                        |        |        |
                   Dashboard  Models  Alerts
```

### 3. Return Verification Flow
```
User Camera -> Mobile App -> Edge Processing
                  |               |
              Basic Validation    |
                  |               v
                  +---------> API Gateway
                                  |
                            Vision Service
                            /     |     \
                           /      |      \
                    Damage   Parking   Fraud
                    Detection  Verify  Detection
                        |        |        |
                        +--------+--------+
                                 |
                           Fleet Service
                                 |
                         Payment Processing
```

### 4. AI/ML Data Pipeline
```
Operational Data Sources
    |
    +-- Bookings
    +-- Telemetry
    +-- User Behavior
    +-- External (Weather, Events)
    |
Feature Store <- Feature Engineering
    |
    +-- Real-time Features
    +-- Historical Features
    |
Model Training Pipeline
    |
    +-- Demand Prediction
    +-- Maintenance Prediction
    +-- Fraud Detection
    +-- Route Optimization
    |
Model Registry -> Inference Engine
    |
Business Services <- Predictions
```

### 5. Technician Operations Flow
```
Maintenance Scheduler -> Work Order
          |                   |
    AI Predictions      Task Assignment
          |                   |
    Battery Status      Technician App
    Vehicle Health           |
          |            Route Optimization
          |                  |
    Parts Inventory    Navigation
          |                  |
    Supply Chain       Field Updates
                            |
                      Status Updates -> Fleet Service
```

## Event-Driven Flows

### Core Events
```
Events:
- VehicleBooked
- VehicleUnlocked
- TripStarted
- TripEnded
- ReturnVerified
- PaymentProcessed
- MaintenanceRequired
- BatteryLow
- DemandSpike
- FraudDetected

Event Flow:
Producer -> Event Bus -> Consumers
    |           |           |
Service A    Routing    Service B,C,D
             Logic      (Subscribers)
```

### Event Processing Patterns

1. **Command Events**: Direct service actions
   - UnlockVehicle -> Fleet Service
   - ProcessPayment -> Payment Service

2. **Notification Events**: Multiple consumers
   - TripEnded -> Analytics, Billing, Maintenance
   - FraudDetected -> Security, User Service, Audit

3. **Aggregate Events**: Complex processing
   - DailyUsageReport -> Analytics Engine
   - FleetStatusSnapshot -> Dashboard

## Data Consistency Patterns

### Synchronous Operations
- Payment processing (ACID required)
- Vehicle unlocking (immediate response)
- User authentication

### Eventually Consistent
- Analytics updates
- Recommendation updates
- Report generation

### Saga Patterns
- Booking with payment
- Return with verification
- Maintenance scheduling

## Data Privacy & Security

### PII Data Flow
```
User Data -> Encryption -> Storage
    |            |           |
Tokenization  At Rest    In Transit
    |            |           |
Reference    Encrypted   TLS/SSL
    |         Volume        |
Analytics    Database    Network
(Anonymous)   Storage    Security
```

### Audit Trail
```
All Operations -> Audit Service
                      |
                 Immutable Log
                      |
              Compliance Reports
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
1. **Edge Cache**: Static content, frequent queries
2. **Application Cache**: Session data, user profiles
3. **Database Cache**: Query results
4. **CDN**: Global content distribution

### Data Partitioning
- **By Geography**: Regional data isolation
- **By Time**: Historical vs current data
- **By Vehicle Type**: Different processing needs
- **By User Segment**: Premium vs standard

## Real-time Analytics

### Stream Processing
```
Event Stream -> Stream Processor -> Real-time Analytics
                      |                    |
                Window Functions      Dashboards
                 Aggregations        Alert Rules
                  Filtering         ML Features
```

### Batch Processing
```
Data Lake -> Batch Jobs -> Data Warehouse
    |            |              |
Raw Data    ETL Pipeline   Business Intelligence
Historical  Transformation    Reports
  Backup     Validation      Analytics
```
